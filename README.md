# Android Architecture Component Sample Project
A sample project attempting to use the latest and greatest Android tech. This **WIP** branch attempts to use tech including, but not limited to:
- MVI (on top of MVVM for its `ViewModel` components like Coroutines, Dagger's Hilt DI, and etc.) 
- Jetpack Compose (to further honor the UDF pattern)
- Compose Navigation
- Kotlin Coroutines and Flow
- Hilt DI
- Retrofit2
- OkHttp3
- Room DB
- Unit testing w/ Mockito

Note that the app is getting its data from [News API](https://newsapi.org).
